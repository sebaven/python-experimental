# bird-towers
bird watching towers in Finland, implemented in Python

When in Finland, I enjoy hiking and spending time in forest enjoying the beautiful nature and landscape. 
I am especially interested in observing local wild life such as birds. 
Finland has many locations to observe birds, different watch towers located all over the country. 
My project idea is to read all those towers location (latitude and longitude) from a CSV file, and display them on a map.

- Python 3.6.x or newer
